# Justyce Countryman's CSC 344 "Programming Languages" Worksite

## **About This Page**
Hello! Welcome to my webpage. Just as a brief introduction, I am currently in my second semester at SUNY Oswego after transferring from SUNY Jefferson in Watertown, NY. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I am always optimistic to strive for exceptional progress in academic opportunities, regardless of length or difficulty, which will be a significantly beneficial mindset to hold onto for the rest of college and beyond.

This website will provide documents that represent my work in the CSC 344 (Programming Languages) course at SUNY Oswego. Some documents represent work on **programming assignments**, code, and demos. Other documents will provide my ideas, thinking process, and solutions to **problem sets**, including language description exercises and short texts regarding programming languages. The work is presented chronologically with respect to due dates, and is clearly identified by means of metatext and hypertext.
